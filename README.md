## We have demonstrated a sequence for clinical and preclinical high (3T) and ultra-high fields (37T) scanners. The Novel Rosette kspace dual- echo Acquisition strategy could further enhance integrated and translational research studies to better understand human and non-humans' complex structures and physiologies.

Shen et al. 2023 demonstrated the addition of novel rosette trajectory measurements in 3T 3D ultrashort echo time (UTE) MRI, i.e., to provide further insight into white matter ultrashort T2∗ components. Compared to the other k-space acquisition strategies, the modified rosette k-space trajectory allows a center-out sampling pattern that provides more outer k-space per spoke samples than radial spokes. In addition, the rosette k-space trajectory samples data in a more incoherent pattern. There, it offers the potential for further acceleration using higher under- sampling factors and the compressed sensing technique for reconstruction. Finally, to achieve mesoscopic resolutions (supmillimeter, i.e., 0.5 mm3 for clinical scanners), this specific 3D rosette k-space design overcomes the slew rate limitation with very high duty cycle/sampling efficiency and better kspace coverage, resulting in high-resolution images with more than %30 SNR improvement.
Human measurements were made at 7T Terra and 3T Prisma Siemens scanners for 1H, 23NA, and 31P nuclei. Dual-echo 3D UTE (first echo time 20 μs, nominal resolution 0.9 mm3, 0.4 mm3), UTE magnetization transfer (20 μs, 0.9 mm3), UTE bSSFP (20 μs, 0.9 mm3), UTE 31P 3D UTE MRSI (50 μs, 10 mm3 ), 23NA 3D UTE MRI (100 μs, 2 mm3 )and very short echo time fMRI (first echo 1.6 ms, 0.5 mm2 in-plane resolution) experiments were conducted at 3T and 7T (only for 1H). Identical 1H acquisitions were performed for the 9.4T Bruker scanner with a shorter TE (8 μs) for marmosets and rats. In addition, 2D MRSI for mega-editing for GABA was tested with a spectral bandwidth of 3.5 kHz. (https://github.com/uzayemir).
High-quality images and spectra were obtained. We have demonstrated a sequence for clinical and preclinical high (3T) and ultra-high fields (37T) scanners. The Novel Rosette kspace dual- echo Acquisition strategy could further enhance integrated and translational research studies to better understand human and non-humans' complex structures and physiologies.
